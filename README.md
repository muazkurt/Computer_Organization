[HW 01](https://github.com/muazkurt/Computer_Organization/tree/master/HW%2001) is a program that reads a input line from user and checks 
  whether there is a integer in between 0...9 or not. 
  Then if finds one, updates it with it's string representation.
  For instance; 
    I am 7 years old. (input)
    will be
    I am seven years old.
